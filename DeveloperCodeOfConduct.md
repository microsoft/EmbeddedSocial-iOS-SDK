# Developer Code of Conduct for Embedded Social

Thanks for incorporating the features of Embedded Social into your application.
We ask for your help in protecting the users of your Embedded Social-enabled application by doing the following:

### Privacy
You must adhere to all applicable privacy regulations. For example, collecting personal information from children triggers obligations under privacy laws that exceed those applicable to collecting information from adults.

Your application needs to have a privacy statement. This statement should cover what data you are collecting, what you will be doing with that data, and who you'll be sharing it with. Your privacy statement needs to be prominently linked off a main menu in your application.

You need to include the following in your privacy statement:

    If you choose to use Embedded Social features in this application, understand that
    - your content may be accessed by Microsoft for product improvement purposes. For more information about Microsoft privacy policies please see their privacy statement here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839
    - anonymized data from your Embedded Social activity may be shared with <insert name of your app company> for product improvement purposes. 
    To report abuse of Embedded Social to Microsoft, please select the abusive content or user, select the report option and follow the subsequent screens. 

You need to include the following notice & consent in the Embedded Social First Run Experience (a.k.a. “Signup UI”) for the user when they create an Embedded Social account:

    By creating an Embedded Social account, I agree to the Microsoft 
    - Privacy policy
    - Terms of Use
    The application you are using may have additional terms.
where the Privacylink above needs to point to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839, and the Terms of Use link needs to point to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977. 

### Reporting abuse & requests to access or delete personal information: 
Your application must provide a way for users to report abuse and delete content that they have authored. We ask that you use the mechanism we provide in Embedded Social for reporting abuse and deleting content. 

### Don’t build apps with the following intent:
- To invade anyone's privacy by attempting to discover, harvest, collect, store, or publish private or personally identifiable information without their knowledge and consent;
- To harm or exploit minors in any way; or
- To defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten, or otherwise violate the legal rights of others.
See the [Microsoft Terms of Use](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977) for more details on prohibited uses of Embedded Social.

### Code of Conduct for Applications
If there is conduct you would like to prohibit in your application, that is not already covered by the [Terms of Use](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977) then you will need to include it in your application’s own Code of Conduct that you create. That Code of Conduct should be prominently linked off a main menu in your application.

### Termination
If this Developer Code of Conduct is not followed, Microsoft reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so, to review and remove content and to terminate your application’s access to the Embedded Social features.
